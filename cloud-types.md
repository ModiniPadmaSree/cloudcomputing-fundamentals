Public, Private, and Hybrid Clouds \
Cloud deployment models define where infrastructure is hosted and who has access to it.
1. Public Cloud \
Public cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by third-party cloud providers and delivered over the internet. Resources such as servers and storage are shared among multiple customers. \
Public clouds are highly scalable and cost-effective because organizations do not need to invest in physical hardware. They follow a pay-as-you-go model and allow rapid provisioning of services. \
Advantages include high scalability, global accessibility, lower upfront cost, automatic updates, and reduced maintenance effort. \
Examples: \
Amazon Web Services \
Microsoft Azure \
Google Cloud Platform \
Public cloud is best suited for startups, web applications, testing environments, and scalable workloads.
2. Private Cloud \
A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization. It may be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider but is not shared with other customers. \
Private clouds offer enhanced security, control, and compliance. Organizations with strict regulatory requirements (like banking or healthcare) often prefer private clouds. \
It provides better customization and data governance but requires higher cost and management effort. \
Private clouds are commonly used for sensitive workloads and mission-critical applications.
3. Hybrid Cloud \
Hybrid cloud combines public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to move between them. \
This model offers flexibility and optimal resource allocation. Organizations can run sensitive applications in private cloud while leveraging public cloud for scalability. \
Hybrid cloud supports cloud bursting, disaster recovery, and workload optimization. It balances cost efficiency and security. \
Example scenario: A company stores confidential data in private cloud but uses AWS for scaling web traffic during peak demand.
