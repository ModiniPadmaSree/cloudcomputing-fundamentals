Cloud Service Models \
Cloud computing is delivered through three primary service models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These models define how much responsibility the cloud provider handles versus what the user manages.
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In this model, the cloud provider manages the physical hardware, networking, storage, and virtualization layer, while the customer is responsible for managing the operating system, middleware, runtime, applications, and data. \
IaaS gives users maximum flexibility and control over infrastructure. It is similar to renting virtual servers instead of buying physical hardware. Organizations can quickly provision virtual machines, scale resources up or down, and pay only for what they use. \
Key characteristics of IaaS include on-demand resource allocation, scalability, high availability, and a pay-as-you-go pricing model. It is widely used for hosting websites, running enterprise applications, disaster recovery setups, and development/testing environments. \
Examples: \
Amazon Web Services – EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) \
Microsoft Azure – Azure Virtual Machines \
Google Cloud Platform – Compute Engine.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) \
Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a development and deployment environment in the cloud. The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, operating system, middleware, and runtime, while the user focuses only on application development and data. \
PaaS simplifies application development because developers do not need to worry about managing servers, configuring operating systems, or handling scaling manually. It provides built-in tools for deployment, monitoring, and scaling. \
PaaS is ideal for developers who want to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. It supports faster development cycles and is commonly used in DevOps and agile environments. \
Examples: \
Amazon Web Services – Elastic Beanstalk \
Microsoft Azure – Azure App Service \
Google Cloud Platform – App Engine \
In this model, operational complexity is reduced, making it suitable for modern web and mobile application development.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS) \
Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers fully functional software applications over the internet. The cloud provider manages everything including infrastructure, platform, application, and data storage. Users simply access the software through a web browser or client application. \
SaaS eliminates the need for installation, maintenance, or updates, as all management is handled by the provider. It is subscription-based and accessible from anywhere with internet connectivity. \
SaaS is widely used for email services, CRM systems, collaboration tools, and productivity software. \
Examples: \
Google – Google Workspace \
Salesforce – Salesforce CRM \
Microsoft – Microsoft 365 \
In SaaS, users have minimal control but maximum convenience.
