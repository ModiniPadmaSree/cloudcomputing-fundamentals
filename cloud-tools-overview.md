Cloud platforms provide a wide range of services that support infrastructure management, application deployment, automation, and DevOps practices. The three leading cloud providers—AWS, Azure, and GCP—offer powerful tools that enable scalable and reliable cloud solutions. \
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS) \
Amazon Web Services is the largest and most widely adopted cloud platform, offering extensive services for computing, storage, networking, and DevOps automation.
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable virtual servers in the cloud. It allows users to launch and manage virtual machines with full control over the operating system and configurations.
- S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service designed for high durability and availability. It is commonly used for storing application data, backups, logs, and static website content.
- AWS Lambda enables serverless computing by allowing developers to run code without managing servers. It automatically scales based on incoming requests and follows an event-driven execution model.
- CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows users to define and provision cloud resources using templates. This ensures consistent and automated environment setup.
- CodePipeline is a CI/CD service that automates the build, test, and deployment process, helping teams release applications faster and more reliably. \
2. Microsoft Azure \
Microsoft Azure is a widely used enterprise cloud platform that integrates seamlessly with Microsoft products and services.
- Azure Virtual Machines provide scalable compute resources in the cloud. They support both Windows and Linux environments for hosting applications.
- Azure App Service is a PaaS offering that allows developers to build, deploy, and scale web applications without managing infrastructure.
- Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that executes code in response to events, reducing infrastructure management overhead.
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies container orchestration, deployment, and scaling of microservices applications.
- Azure DevOps provides tools for version control, build pipelines, testing, and release management, supporting complete CI/CD workflows. \
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) \
Google Cloud Platform is known for its strengths in containerization, data analytics, and high-performance computing.
- Compute Engine provides virtual machines running in Google’s data centers. It offers customizable machine types and global scalability.
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deployment and management of containerized applications.
- Cloud Functions is a serverless platform that executes event-driven code without requiring server management.
- Cloud Build is a CI/CD service that automates application builds, tests, and deployments directly from source repositories.
- BigQuery is a fully managed data warehouse that enables large-scale data analytics using SQL queries with high performance.
